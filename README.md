# Python Project Template
This is my template for projects in Python. This template uses GitHub Workflows to check formatting and run tests.

### Built With
I use the commong code formatter [black](https://github.com/psf/black) as a formatter and [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) as a linter.

## Getting Started
You can use this template as you want for your projects and customize things. Because this is a template repository i added these empty blocks to the README:
